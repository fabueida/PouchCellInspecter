Pouch Cell Inspector

The battery pouch cells  identifier mobile application  is a cutting edge tool that uses machine-learning–powered computer vision to detect bulging lithium-ion pouch cells using only an iPhone camera.

Built with Swift, SwiftUI, Vision, and CoreML, the app delivers a fast, reliable, and fully on-device battery safety inspection tool designed for:
	•	🔧 Technicians
	•	🧪 Engineers & researchers
	•	🏭 Lab and industrial environments
	•	📱 Field inspections

The system emphasizes accuracy, accessibility, privacy, and real-world usability, enabling safe and consistent inspections without specialized hardware.

🎯 Project Purpose

Lithium-ion pouch cells may bulge due to gas buildup, aging, overcharging, or internal failure. Swelling is an early warning sign of potential battery hazards.

Pouch Cell Inspector was developed to:
	•	Provide rapid visual safety checks
	•	Reduce reliance on subjective manual inspection
	•	Deliver consistent ML-based classification
	•	Support documentation and traceability
	•	Enable accessible inspection workflows
	•	Operate fully offline for data privacy

This project is grounded in research on mobile computer vision for battery safety and aims to support real-world industrial and laboratory applications.
